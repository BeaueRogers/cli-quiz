      <h2> My sister's funeral</h2>

          <p>
          Since there was no mother for the peach tree we did it
          all alone, which made the two of us closer
          though closeness brought its loneliness, and it would
          have been better I think sometimes to be sterile
          from the start just to avoid the pain
          which in my life this far has lasted seventy
          years for I am in love with a skeleton
          on whose small bones a dress hung for a while,
          on whose small skull a bit of curly hair
          was strung, and what is dust I still don’t know
          since there was no mother to turn to then and ask
          what else was she wearing, did she have on shoes,
          and were the two trees from Georgia, and was it
          true somebody said the other peach
          should have died instead of her; and I could
          imagine the nose going first though forty years later
          the trees were still there and not as big as you’d think;
          and it was my cousin Red with the flabby lips
          who said it, he had red eyes, a red monstrosity,
          a flabby body, half the house was filled with
          male cousins, they were born in rooms a
          short distance from the rats, I can’t remember
          which ones had the accents nor what his
          Hebrew name was, nor his English.

        <p>Nothing was ever what it claimed to be,</p>
        <p>the earth, blue egg, in its seeping shell</p>
        <p>dispensing damage like a hollow hell</p>
        <p>inchling weeping for a minor sea</p>

        <p>ticking its tidelets, x and y and z.</p>
        <p>The blue beneficence we call and spell</p>
        <p>and call blue heaven, the whiteblue well</p>
        <p>of constant water, deepening a thee,</p>

        <p>a thou and who, touching every what—</p>
        <p class="fav">and in the or, a shudder in the cut—</p>
        <p>and that you are, blue mirror, only stare</p>

        <p>bluest blankness, whether in the where,</p>
        <p>sheen that bleeds blue beauty we are taught</p>
        <p>drowns and booms and vowels.  I will not.</p>
